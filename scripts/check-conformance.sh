#
# That question must never be answered from memory. An agent asked in conversation reports
# its INTENTION, not the facts: in cycle 041 this repository's own agent would have answered
# "yes" while two commits cited a cycle that had no spec at all — the gate found it, the
# memory did not. And a companion agent on another repository reported "CI green" before
# checking it. Memory is not a witness.
#
# What this actually measures (anti-pattern 13): NOT quality, and not whether the human read
# anything. It measures whether the method survived into the artifacts the executor consumes
# — which is the defect that keeps recurring (anti-pattern 22, the installed method as a
# lossy copy). Everything here is a fact readable from disk and git.
#
# It does not re-check what other gates own: lane rationale is check-cycle.sh, roles are
# check-roles.sh, findings debt is check-retro.sh. Duplicating a function already served
# would violate Principle VI.
#
# Machine-readable tokens, not prose, so the check survives translation and rewording
# (the same reasoning as the `fecha` field and the `PT-DATA` marker):
